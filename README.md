# ExpenseTracker

This simple, intuitive web app is built using **Streamlit** to help you track your expenses, visualize spending patterns, and manage your finances better. This is useful for students since it does not include any savings data.  

### Try the App 
Upload your CSV file to see the analytics( If you don't have your expense file yet, you can use the template attached in the web app to either record your spending or fill it with sample data to try the app)
[You can try the live app here:] (https://studentexpensetracker.streamlit.app/)
